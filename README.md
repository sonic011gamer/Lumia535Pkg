# Lumia535Pkg
WIP Custom EDK2 UEFI Firmware for the Microsoft Lumia 535

# Current Status
Should boot Linux just fine, although touch support is an issue. There is an effort to bring msm8212 devices up to mainline on the [Mainline4Lumia](https://github.com/mainline4Lumia/linux-next/tree/for-upstream/msm8212) repo.
Based on [Lumia930Pkg](https://github.com/rickliu2000/Lumia930Pkg) by @rickliu2000
